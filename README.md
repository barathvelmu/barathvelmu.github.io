# Barath's Personal Website ðŸš€
## Introduction
You have just landed on the GitHub repository for my personal website! 

This project was purely built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As of now, this website has been deployed on GitHub pages! I will be pushing updates as time goes by with new features/information update! If you find any bug(s) with the website, please reach out to me at barathvelmu@gmail.com! Thank you!

## What is the goal of this project?
I wanted to create an "electronic resume" for others to get to know me! I want my design and code to speak for me. In addition, this application adopts both a Single Page Application and mobile responsive design. Both concepts were new to me and I am happy I got to learn and experience them :)

## To-do:

1) Finsih Projects/Portfolio section
2) Phone number comes as blue on Safari mobile page. See if can be fixed (e.g., diff color).
3) When site is refreshed, it goes back to home page. Fix this. 
4) Custom alert when form is submitted would look nice. 
5) Add a favicon to website.
6) Mobile projects "View Details" has too much space, fix in "responsive.css".
7) Make gear palette have a colored background (e.g., home page color) and not transparent.
