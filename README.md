# Barath Personal Project
## Introduction
You have just landed on the GitHub repository for my personal website! This project was purely built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As of now, this website has been deployed on GitHub pages! I will be pushing updates as time goes by with new features/information update! If you find any bug(s) with the website, please reach out to me at barathvelmu@gmail.com! Thank you!

## What is the goal of this project?
I wanted to create an "electronic resume" for others to get to know me! I want my design and code to speak for me. In addition, this application adopts both a Single Page Application and mobile responsive design. Both concepts were new to me and I am happy I got to learn and experience them :)
